## Combat

Lets try to make a script that attacks a man.

### Attack Npc

---


To attack an npc we'll have to look into our Rs2Npc utility class.

```java
Rs2Npc.attack("man")
```

Our example script should look like this now.

  ```java
  
    public class ExampleScript extends Script {
    public static double version = 1.0;

    public boolean run(ExampleConfig config) {
    Microbot.enableAutoRunOn = false;
    mainScheduledFuture = scheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(() -> {
      if (!super.run()) return;
      try {

        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        //SCRIPT CODE COMES HERE

        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long totalTime = endTime - startTime;
        System.out.println("Total time for loop " + totalTime);

        } catch (Exception ex) {
          System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
        }
      }, 0, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
      return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void shutdown() {
      super.shutdown();
      }
  }
```

The script should now attack the man!
