Security is at the heart of all we do at Microbot.
Our anti-ban protocols and procedures are designed to protect your account integrity and enhance the longevity of your automation scripts.

This is a work in progress documentation, please wait for it to be updated.

By integrating anti-ban practices into your scripting workflow, you can create a safer and more secure automation experience, reducing the risk of account suspension or bans.

<Aside>
Remember, maintaining account security requires attention to detail. Regularly update your IP rotation, use randomized action sequences, and incorporate breaks to simulate human activity. For additional guidance, explore our community resources or consult our support channels.
