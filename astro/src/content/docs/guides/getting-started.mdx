Welcome to Microbot Docs!
We're thrilled to support your journey with our powerful development tools.
This guide will introduce you to our toolset, walk you through the basics, and prepare you for your first project.
Letâ€™s dive into the world of high-quality, reliable automation with Microbot.


## Setup Instructions

<Steps>

1.  ðŸ“¦ Download the Microbot Client & Java  
    Visit the [Microbot GitHub Releases](https://github.com/chsami/microbot/releases) page to download the latest client snapshot **SHADED** release build. Youâ€™ll also find nightly builds, which are unstable development versionsâ€”recommended only if youâ€™re exploring experimental features.

    If you don't have java installed yet, watch the youtube video in step 1.

    - Simply login with the jagex launcher for the first time. This will create a token for your account. Close everything after succesfully login in through the jagex launcher.
    
    - Open the shaded.jar from microbot and this should prompt you with the jagex account to login.


3.  Jagex Launcher
  
    If you don't have java installed yet, watch the youtube video in step 1.

    Simply replace the Official RuneLite.jar with the microbot.jar and make sure the name is the same!
    
    After that you can start up the jagex launcher and select runelite, this will startup microbot.

4.  Run Microbot on Linux

    Make sure you have Java installed, get it from your package manager.
    Run the "shaded" .jar from the nightly build with: 
    ```bash
    java --jar client-1.10.26-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
    ```
    If you have a Jagex account, download and run Bolt launcher (https://github.com/Adamcake/Bolt). 
    After signing in, run the "shaded" .jar by enabling "Use custom RuneLite JAR" and navigating to the Microbot .jar.
    Download and extract the RuneLite AppImage. Replace RuneLite.jar with the Microbot one. Run RuneLite
