# Rs2Npc Class Documentation

## Overview
The `Rs2Npc` class provides a comprehensive suite of methods for interacting with NPCs within the game. These methods include retrieving NPCs by various attributes, validating NPC interactability, performing actions like attacking or pickpocketing, and handling NPC visibility and targeting through the game's camera and walking systems.

## Methods

### `getNpcByIndex`
- **Description**: Retrieves an NPC based on its unique index.
- **Parameters**:
    - `index`: `int` - The index of the NPC.

## Conclusion
The `Rs2Npc` class is an essential component of the Microbot client, facilitating advanced NPC interaction capabilities for automation tasks. Its methods are designed to handle various aspects of NPC engagement, from basic interactions to complex behaviors like combat and pathfinding.
